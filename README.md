# JetBrainsAcademy-learning-HTML-CSS
Just saving my old code from my [Jetbrains Academy Profile](https://hyperskill.org/profile/144188492). 
These projects were my first attempts to work with HTML and CSS. I did not do anything fancy, just minimum required tasks.

1. [Flashcards](https://hyperskill.org/projects/115?track=5)
